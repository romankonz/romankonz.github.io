## TL;DR

This is my first post. I've wrote it in hurry to test if jekyll is up and running. 
Maybe you should stop reading now.

## my blog

My name is Roman Konz, i'm 34 years old and i live in Germany.
I'm a professional software developer since 12 years.

And i've just started this jekyll based blog.

My primary intention with this blog is to organise my thoughts about programming, tools, frameworks...
I also read a lot in english, but i can't write well in english. 
And I hope writing this blog will help me to get better.

## conclusion 

I promise, my next post will have a topic.
